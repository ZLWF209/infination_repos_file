# Project name 
Infination

# Theme 
The main theme for my project is to showcase the risks that come from the infinite scroll, which consistently generates new search results every time you reach the end of the page. In this case, the plan is to generate around 50+ posts from various social media sites and have them as part of the infinite scroll. Most of the posts later down the line would be speaking towards you and as to why you are still scrolling down the page and why you are continuing to do so.

# Mechanics 
The mechanics that are used throughout my project will be a link going towards the infinite scroll that the user will be exploring. They will also be able to click on some of the tweets and look at a few threads linking towards them. Some of the content will represent information irrelevant to the post itself, showing one of the cons of the system.

# Aesthetics 
The page will feature a red dialogue box in front of a backdrop where it will consistently loop through images relating to the infinite scrolling matter.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to showcase that sometimes engagement with this function can be taken too far, especially if they scroll down a lot and come across a promising search, only to be led towards somewhere else on the web – possibly towards something predatory. It also tries to aim how people shouldn’t go wasting their time constantly scrolling since the results become less relevant, especially those who are looking for something specific.

# Technology 
I will plan to use the html software to create the code for both generating images and for the infinite scroll. If possible, I might also use a function to randomly generate these images as part of my database for each time.
